NOTE supporting the append operation on files: the temptation is to use a file descriptor,
and implement append by ensuring that the fd position is always at the end of the file;
usually this works fine, but if we allow pread and pwrite, then it can be that pwrite
extends the file, so that the fd position is no longer at the end of the file; then append
requires an lseek to the end of the file; on Linux, if we try to use a file in O_APPEND
mode, then pwrites will automatically go to the end of the file
